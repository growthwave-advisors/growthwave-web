## Email 1: Same Day (Warm Connection)

**Subject Line:** Great connecting at WOWCON 🚀

**Preview Text:** Here's that guide I mentioned—packed with what you need to know

**Body Copy:**

Hey [First Name],

Really enjoyed connecting with you at WOWCON today. It's rare to meet other real estate investors who are as thoughtful about their business structure and capital strategy as you are.

I promised to send over something useful, so here it is: **The RE Investor's Guide to Business Credit**

This guide walks through the exact framework that's helped me and my clients leverage business credit to unlock institutional capital for multifamily deals. It covers:

- How business credit works differently than personal credit (and why that matters)
- The specific steps to build credit that lenders actually respect
- Common mistakes that cost investors thousands in missed opportunities
- A simple system to keep this on autopilot

You can grab it here: **growthwavecapital.com/wowcon**

No opt-in forms, no gatekeeping—just genuine content to help you think about your capital strategy.

Looking forward to staying connected and seeing what you build next.

## Email 2: +2 Days (Educational Value-Add)

**Subject Line:** The #1 thing I wish I knew before my first multifamily deal

**Preview Text:** It would've saved me years of frustration (and probably six figures)

**Body Copy:**

Hey [First Name],

Thinking back on my first multifamily deal, if I could go back and tell myself one thing, it would be this:

**Business credit is your competitive advantage as a real estate investor.**

Most investors I meet are laser-focused on the property—square footage, CAP rate, tenant profile. All important. But the one thing they *overlook* is how they're financing it.

Here's what I mean: If you're relying solely on personal credit and balance sheet, you're competing with everyone else for the same limited institutional capital. But if you've built actual *business credit* separate from your personal finances, you open up entire lending channels that other investors don't even know exist.

I see it all the time—investors with solid deals get outbid because they don't have the credit structure to access the capital fast enough. Or they end up using hard money at 12% instead of institutional money at 4% because they didn't plan ahead.

The guide I sent over walks through exactly how to set this up. It's not complicated—it just requires thinking about it *before* your next deal, not during it.

If you haven't grabbed it yet, check it out here: **growthwavecapital.com/wowcon**

The sooner you get this piece handled, the sooner your deals get easier.

## Email 3: +5 Days (Engagement & Direct CTA)

**Subject Line:** Quick question about your 90-day plan

**Preview Text:** Did the guide give you any ideas for next steps?

**Body Copy:**

Hey [First Name],

One thing I loved about WOWCON was the action-oriented vibe—everyone there was clear about what they wanted to build in the next 90 days.

That made me think: if you *did* decide to get serious about your business credit strategy, what would be your first move?

Some investors start by pulling their business credit reports and seeing where they stand. Others jump straight into opening some strategic trade lines. A few (the really serious ones) map out their entire financing strategy for their next 3-5 deals.

All of these are different 90-day action plans, and the right one depends on where you're starting from.

If this is something that interests you, I'd love to spend 15-20 minutes just talking through where *you* are right now and what a realistic first step would look like. No pitch, no pressure—just a conversation between two investors.

You can grab a time on my calendar here: **https://crm.advisorhub.io/widget/booking/AsuuzTkGKAx6v6K8L4xp**

Even if now isn't the right time, keep this in your back pocket for when it is. And either way, rooting for your next deal.
