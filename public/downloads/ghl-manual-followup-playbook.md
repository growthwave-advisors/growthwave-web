## Phase 2: Day-Of Follow-Up (Same Day as Conference)

### Timeline: Send within 6-24 hours of meeting

**Email to send:** [Email 1 from the sequence](https://growthwavecapital.com/wowcon)

### Option A: If GHL Automation is Live
1. Contact should auto-trigger into the email sequence
2. Email 1 sends automatically
3. Check GHL dashboard to confirm send

### Option B: If Automation is NOT Live (Manual Send)

**Via Gmail:**
1. Copy the Email 1 body from the email sequence document
2. Personalize the greeting with their first name
3. Send from your GrowthWave email address
4. Log the send in GHL: Open contact → add note → "Email 1 sent [date]"

**Via GHL:**
1. Go to contact record in GHL
2. Click **"Send Email"** or **"Compose"**
3. Paste Email 1 body
4. Verify recipient email address
5. Send
6. GHL should auto-log the activity

### What to Monitor
- Track opens (if using GHL email tracking)
- Note any replies in the contact record
- If they reply, move pipeline stage to **"Relationship Building"** immediately

---

## Phase 3: Day 2-3 Follow-Up

### Timeline: Send 2-3 days after initial conference contact

**Email to send:** [Email 2 from the sequence](https://growthwavecapital.com/wowcon)

### Send Steps
1. Go to contact record in GHL
2. **If they replied to Email 1:** Reference their reply in a personalized note instead
3. **If no reply yet:** Send Email 2 as scheduled
4. Add note: "Email 2 sent [date]"

### Response Tracking
- Did they click the guide link?
- Did they reply with questions?
- **If yes:** Treat this as warm engagement → move to "Relationship Building" stage
- **If no:** Continue to Email 3 as planned

### Quick Response Templates (If They Engage)
**If they ask about the guide:**
> "Great question! The guide walks through [specific section]. Happy to dive deeper on [their specific question]—would be a good topic for a call if you want to go deeper."

**If they ask about your services:**
> "Love that you're thinking about this. Let's carve out 20 minutes to map out what a smart next step looks like for your situation. You can grab a time here: [calendar link]"

---

## Phase 4: Day 5-7 Follow-Up

### Timeline: Send 5-7 days after initial contact

**Email to send:** [Email 3 from the sequence](https://growthwavecapital.com/wowcon)

### Send Steps
1. Go to contact record in GHL
2. Send Email 3 (includes calendar link for strategy call)
3. Add note: "Email 3 sent [date]"

### Response Tracking & Next Steps

**Scenario A: They Book a Call**
- Confirm the meeting in their calendar
- Move contact to **"Relationship Building"** stage
- Add note with call date/time
- Prepare 1-page brief on their business (if you have info)
- Send calendar reminder 24 hours before call

**Scenario B: No Response Yet**
- Wait 7 more days
- Send a brief, low-pressure check-in note (see templates below)
- If still no response after 2 weeks: move to "nurture" track (check in monthly)

**Scenario C: They Unsubscribe**
- Respect it, remove from sequence
- Keep contact record for reference
- Do not re-add to campaigns

---

## Phase 5: Week 2-3 (Follow-Up to Non-Responders)

### One Last Gentle Nudge (If Appropriate)

**Send:** Week 2-3 (10-14 days after Email 3)

**Template:**
> Hey [First Name],
>
> Just wanted to check in. I know inboxes get crazy after conferences like WOWCON.
>
> If now's not the right time to jump on a call, totally understand. But if you *are* thinking about your business credit strategy in the next 90 days, would be happy to help you think through it.
>
> One way or another, rooting for your next deal.
>
> Wilfred

**Then:**
- If no response → move to monthly nurture (check-in every 30 days with valuable content)
- If they do respond → book that call and move to "Relationship Building"

## Pipeline Stage Guide

### Understanding the JV Partners Pipeline

| Stage | Definition | What It Means | Action Items |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Identified** | You met them at WOWCON, exchanged info | "Person + opportunity identified" | Send sequence, build relationship |
| **Relationship Building** | They're engaging (opened emails, booked call, replied) | "They're interested, building rapport" | Schedule & complete strategy call, understand their goals |
| **Qualified** | Call completed; they fit your JV criteria | "This is a real opportunity" | Present specific deal or partnership framework |
| **Deal Presented** | You've pitched a deal or opportunity | "They know what you can do together" | Negotiate terms, send agreements |
| **Committed** | They're in, paperwork signed or LOI executed | "Partner confirmed for deal(s)" | Execute deal, maintain relationship |

### When to Move Between Stages
- **Identified → Relationship Building:** When they respond/engage or book a call
- **Relationship Building → Qualified:** After strategy call if they meet your criteria
- **Qualified → Deal Presented:** When you have a specific deal to offer them
- **Deal Presented → Committed:** When they sign LOI or agreement

## Quick Reference: Copy-Paste Messages

### For Use During WOWCON (Zoom Chat / Slack)

---

### Message 1: Introduction
**Use this:** First time you're introducing yourself in a chat/break room

```
Hey everyone 👋 Wilfred Morgan with GrowthWave Capital.

We help real estate investors structure business credit so they can access institutional capital faster and cheaper. If you're building a multifamily portfolio, this usually saves you 2-4% on financing costs.

Happy to chat about real estate capital strategies if that's interesting to you.
```

---

### Message 2: Value-Add Share
**Use this:** In response to a question about financing or capital

```
Quick insight: Most investors focus on the deal itself (property, tenants, market), but miss the financing strategy piece.

If you set up business credit early, you access institutional capital (4-6%) instead of hard money (10-12%). Same deal, but $40K-80K cheaper every year.

I put together a quick guide on this if you're interested: growthwavecapital.com/wowcon
```

---

### Message 3: Lead Magnet Offer (Direct Call-to-Action)
**Use this:** When someone seems genuinely interested, direct them to the guide

```
Exactly—this is what we see all the time.

I just published "The RE Investor's Guide to Business Credit" that walks through the framework we use with our clients. No pitch, just practical steps.

Free download here: growthwavecapital.com/wowcon

Grab it and let me know if you want to talk through how to apply it to your situation.
```

---

### Message 4: Booking CTA
**Use this:** Near end of conversation, if they're genuinely interested

```
I'm getting a sense that this could be really relevant for your next deal.

Would be happy to spend 15 minutes just mapping out what a smart first step would look like for you. No obligation:

Either way, great connecting and rooting for your projects.
```

---

### Bonus: Quick Follow-Up DM Template
**Use this:** If you connect with someone on LinkedIn immediately after WOWCON

```
Hey [First Name],

Great connecting at WOWCON. Wanted to make sure you had that guide I mentioned:

growthwavecapital.com/wowcon

Looking forward to staying connected and seeing what you build next.

— Wilfred

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Email bounced / invalid address**
- Check the email address against their LinkedIn or company website
- Ask via another channel (LinkedIn DM) for correct email
- Update in GHL

**Q: They replied asking about pricing/services**
- Don't sell in email—invite them to a call instead
- Use template: "Great question! Let's carve out 15 min to talk through what this could look like for your specific situation. [calendar link]"

**Q: They're interested but it's not the right time for them**
- Add to nurture track (monthly check-ins with helpful content)
- Tag as `engagement:nurture`
- Check in every 30 days

**Q: They unsubscribed**
- Respect it, remove from campaigns
- Don't re-add unless they specifically ask

**Q: No response to any emails**
- This is normal (typical open rate: 20-30%, click rate: 5-10%)
- Send one final gentle note around day 14
- Move to monthly nurture if no response
- Not everyone is a fit; that's okay

---

## Success Metrics

By the end of WOWCON follow-up (30 days):

- **Target:** 3-5 strategy calls booked from 30-50 contacts
- **Email open rate target:** 25-35%
- **Click-through rate target:** 8-12%
- **Response rate target:** 5-10%

If you're hitting these, the sequence is working. If not:
- Test different send times
- Review subject lines for clarity
- Ensure personalization is working
- Check that calendar link is working

---

## Final Notes

- **Tone over everything:** Keep it contribution-first. You're helping, not pitching.
- **Consistency:** Don't skip days. The sequence works because it's spaced right.
- **Follow-through:** If someone books a call, be prepared. They're testing whether you're real.
- **Tag everyone:** Tags make it easy to run reports and see what's working later.
- **Keep notes:** Add a brief note in GHL each time you contact someone. Future you will thank current you.
