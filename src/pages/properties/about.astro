        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6">
          <p class="text-lg">
            GrowthWave Properties was founded on a simple observation: most real estate investors face the same two challenges—finding quality deals and accessing the capital to execute them. While many firms address one or the other, we built an integrated platform that solves both.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            Our approach combines over a decade of banking and financial services leadership with professional real estate training and enterprise technology expertise. This unique background allows us to underwrite properties with institutional rigor, operate with professional-grade systems, and provide transparency that builds lasting investor relationships.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            As part of the GrowthWave Advisors ecosystem, we're not just real estate operators—we're wealth-building partners who help clients progress from credit optimization through business financing to property ownership. This integration creates better-prepared, better-capitalized partners who understand leverage and long-term value creation.

              <p>
                Wilfred brings 15+ years of banking and financial services leadership to multifamily real estate investing. As former Chief Technology Officer at a federal credit union, he led enterprise technology initiatives and gained deep insights into lending operations, risk management, and financial systems.

    <!-- Core Principles Section -->

      <div class="container-custom">
        <h2 class="text-center mb-12">Our Principles</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="text-properties-coral mb-3">Conservative Underwriting</h3>
            <p>
              We analyze dozens of properties for every acquisition. Our underwriting includes worst-case scenarios, meaningful reserves, and clear value-add pathways. If a deal doesn't meet our strict risk-adjusted return criteria, we walk away—even when it means waiting months for the next opportunity.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="text-properties-coral mb-3">Operational Excellence</h3>
            <p>
              Professional property management oversight, systematic renovation execution, and proactive tenant relations create stable operations and consistent performance. We treat every property as if our own capital were the only capital at risk.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="text-properties-coral mb-3">Technology-Enabled Transparency</h3>
            <p>
              Enterprise-grade systems provide real-time financial reporting, automated investor updates, and complete visibility into property performance. Our investors never have to chase us for information—data flows automatically through professional platforms.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="text-properties-coral mb-3">Aligned Interests</h3>
            <p>
              We invest alongside our partners and structure deals where our success depends entirely on delivering results. When our partners win, we win. This alignment drives every decision we make.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3 class="text-properties-coral mb-3">Long-Term Relationships</h3>
            <p>
              We're building a portfolio and a reputation, not chasing transaction volume. Many partners complete multiple investment cycles with us, using 1031 exchanges to compound wealth across increasingly valuable properties.
            </p>
